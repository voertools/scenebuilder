		<p>Start a line with // to trigger the parser. It can find if-statements but don't use an else until the end. Or if it finds //merge it will collapse the if-tree. Right now, you can't nest if-statements.</p>
		<p>All other text will be interpreted as if it were output text. Please leave all standard parser calls in [straight brackets]. Use {curly braces} for things the parser can't do. Also, it will fix your quotes and en-dashes (if you double--hyphen) for you. It also adds italics tags for quotes. Outside of quotes.however, you need to add the tags yourself as well as any bold tags.</p>
		<p>This tool does not promise perfectly formatted code ready to just be dropped in. It's just to streamline some basic handling and get a first pass done, simple scenes will be perfectly fine here. Ideally, it should be ready to drop into a function and add some buttons.</p>
		<p>We could even add an author tag if you put a name here!
			<input type=text id=author>
